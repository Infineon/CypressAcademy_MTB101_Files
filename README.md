# ModusToolbox_101

Recently, while teaching a group of people how to use ModusToolbox, Alan Hawse walked up behind one of the students. The student was literally giggling with glee as he built the IoT examples. "I reflected on the ocean of technology inside of this toolbox: Wi-Fi, CapSense, Bluetooth, PSoC, PDL, Mbed, FreeRTOS, HAL, drivers, middleware and on and on. But, none of those things can replace the joy that comes with a great user experience. This experience reflects the remarkable set of tools that we built."

This class is a survey of the Cypress IoT development platform ModusToolbox 2.0. The learning objective is to introduce you to all the tools in ModusToolbox and help you develop some familiarity with using them. The class is “a mile wide and an inch deep.” This should enable you to understand the scope of the Cypress development ecosystem and teach you where to find “everything.”

The PDF files in this repository are used in the classroom course. This class touches on PSoC 6, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FreeRTOS, Mbed OS, and Amazon Web Services, but it is not an in-depth study of any of those topics. You can learn more by taking PSoC 101, Cypress Wi-Fi 101 and Cypress Bluetooth 101.

To develop applications using these tools, you need to have good C-programming skills as most of the development effort with these types of chips is spent writing programs. Your skills should include:

·     C Control Structure

·     C Variables (Data)

·     Multi-file programs

·     Linking

·     RTOS

·     IoT Frameworks – MQTT, HTTP

·     Bluetooth Low Energy
